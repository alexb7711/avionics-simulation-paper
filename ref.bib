	abstract = {Aircraft are composed of many electronic systems: sensors, displays, navigation equipment, and communication elements. These elements require a reliable interconnection, which is a major challenge for communication networks since high reliability and predictability requirements must be verified for safe operation. In addition, their verification via hardware deployments is limited because these are costly and it is difficult to try different architectures and configurations, thus delaying design and development in this area. Therefore, verification at early stages in the design process is of great importance and must be supported with simulation. In this context, this work presents an event-driven link-level framework and simulator for the validation of avionics networks. The tool presented supports communication protocols commonly used in avionics, such as Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet ({AFDX}), as well as Ethernet, which is used with static routing. Also, the simulator provides accurate results by employing realistic models for various devices. The proposed platform was evaluated in the Clean Sky’s Disruptive Cockpit for Large Passenger Aircraft architecture scenario, showing the capabilities of the simulator. Verification speed is a key factor in its application, so the computational cost was analyzed, proving that the execution time is linearly dependent on the number of messages sent and that the increase in the number of nodes has few quadratic components.},

	abstract = {The development of guidance, navigation and control algorithms and avionic procedures requires the disposability of suitable analysis and verification tools, such as simulation environments, which support the design process and allow detecting potential problems prior to the flight test, in order to make new technologies available at reduced cost, time and risk. This paper presents a simulation environment for avionic software development and qualification, especially aimed at equipment for general aviation aircrafts and unmanned aerial systems. The simulation environment includes models for short and medium-range radio-navigation aids, flight assistance systems, and ground control stations. All the software modules are able to simulate the modeled systems both in fast-time and real-time tests, and were implemented following component oriented modeling techniques and requirement based approach. The paper describes the specific models features, the architectures of the implemented software systems and its validation process. Performed validation tests highlighted the capability of the simulation environment to guarantee in real-time the required functionalities and performance of the simulated avionics systems, as well as to reproduce the interaction between these systems, thus permitting a realistic and reliable simulation of a complete mission scenario.},

	abstract = {Avionics systems, which determine the performance, stability, and safety of aircraft, are a crucial part of aircraft. With the rapid development of the aviation industry, there are many serious problems in the process of the traditional simulation and verification of avionics systems, especially in the aspects of poor reusability of the hardware and software, poor real-time data interaction, and the high cost of development. In order to solve these problems, a simulation and verification platform for avionics systems based on the Future Airborne Capability Environment ({FACE}) architecture has been designed by using component and memory database technology. First, a general architecture is designed by referencing the {FACE} architecture, which allows flexible access to software and hardware resources of avionics systems. Second, the key technologies involved in the platform are described in detail, including scheduling management, communication management, and configuration management, which provide technical support for the simulation and verification of avionics systems. Finally, the simulation and verification environment of avionics systems is established, which realizes data interaction and management of various models, and improves the efficiency of the development and implementation of avionics systems.},

The U-space concept of operations ({ConOps}) provides a high-level description of the architecture, requirements and functionalities of these systems, but the implementer has a certain degree of freedom in aspects like the techniques used or some policies and procedures. The current document describes some of those implementation decisions. The prototype included part of the services defined by the {ConOps}, namely e-identification, Tracking, Geo-awareness, Drone Aeronautical Information Management, Geo-fence Provision, Operation Plan Preparation/Optimization, Operation Plan Processing, Strategic Conflict Resolution, Tactical Conflict Resolution, Emergency Management, Monitoring, Traffic Information and Legal Recording. Moreover, a Web app interface was developed for the operator/pilot. The system was tested in simulations and real visual line of sight ({VLOS}) and beyond {VLOS} ({BVLOS}) flights, with both vertical take-off and landing ({VTOL}) and fixed-wing platforms, while assisting final users interested in incorporating drones to support their tasks. The development and testing of the environment provided lessons at different levels: functionalities, compatibility, procedures, information, usability, ground control station ({GCS}) integration and aircrew roles.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a Reusable Launch Vehicle ({RLV}) descent dynamics simulator coupled with closed-loop guidance and control (G\&C) integration. The studied vehicle’s first-stage booster, evolving in the terrestrial atmosphere, is steered by a Thrust Vector Control ({TVC}) system and planar fins through gain-scheduled Proportional–Integral–Derivative controllers, correcting the trajectory deviations until precise landing from the reference profile computed in real time by a successive convex optimisation algorithm. Environmental and aerodynamic models that reproduce realistic atmospheric conditions are integrated into the simulator for enhanced assessment. Comparative performance results were achieved in terms of control configuration ({TVC}-only, fins-only, and both) for nominal conditions as well as with external disturbances such as wind gusts or multiple uncertainties through a Monte Carlo analysis to assess the G\&C system. These studies demonstrated that the configuration combining {TVC} and steerable planar fins has sufficient control authority to provide stable flight and adequate uncertainties and disturbance rejection. The developed simulator provides a preliminary assessment of G\&C techniques for the {RLV} descent and landing phase, along with examining the interactions that occur. In particular, it paves the way towards the development and assessment of more advanced and robust algorithms.},

Derived from the version of Airborne Collision Avoidance System X ({ACAS} X) for large {UAS} ({ACAS} Xu), a new member of the {ACAS} X family for {sUAS} ({ACAS} {sXu}) is being developed by the Federal Aviation Administration’s ({FAA}’s) Traffic-Alert and Collision Avoidance System ({TCAS}) Program Office. {ACAS} {sXu} is intended to provide both collision avoidance ({CA}) and remain well clear ({RWC}) capabilities with both vertical and horizontal advisories for the remote pilot in command ({RPIC}) and/or automated response system onboard the aircraft. {ACAS} {sXu} is envisioned to utilize a standard logic to serve {sUASs} with different equipages and operating in different airspace domains. The standard {ACAS} {sXu} logic may be hosted either in the embedded environment on board the {sUAS} vehicle or in a Cloud environment such as a {UAS} traffic management ({UTM}) Service Suppler ({USS}) platform. It may be integrated with surveillance sources such as Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast ({ADS}-B), the anticipated remote identification (remote {ID}) tracking, networked/shared telemetry, airborne surveillance radar, and ground based surveillance radar, for both cooperative and non-cooperative intruders. To demonstrate proof of concept, gather surveillance data, verify simulation environment, and characterize early logic performance, the {FAA} and industry partners integrated {DAA} systems featuring the {ACAS} {sXu} logic Version 0, in both embedded environments and a Cloud environment, and successfully conducted a week-long flight test in October 2018 at the New York {UAS} Test Site in Rome, {NY}.

	abstract = {This paper discusses the methods of flight simulation; specifically
real-time simulation of airplanes. The paper describes methods to
form a minimal, but complete, flight simulator. The simulator basically operates by solving the airplane’s equations of motion of the airplane in real time. The major part of solving the equations of motion
is determining the total force and moment on the airplane. There are
many ways to model aerodynamic forces. This paper describes three
general models: polynomial modeling, where each resultant force and
moment is expressed as a polynomial function; multipoint modeling,
where different parts of the aircraft are modeled separately; and tabular modeling, where the forces and moments are looked up in tables.
The simulator must also calculate forces and moments produced by
the engine and landing gear. The simulator solves the equations of
motion in a real-time loop. In each loop, outputs the scenery based
on the state, inputs the control positions and settings, calculates the
state at the next time step, and finally pauses to synchronize the loop
to real time.},

            This paper outlines the development of flight simulators used in civil training, military training and in engineering simulation. It describes the evolution of flight simulators and the typical architecture of a modern flight simulator. The technical innovations, which have occurred in modelling, motion systems and visual systems are reviewed. The paper also reviews the transfer of training in flight simulation, the application of simulation to engineering design and outlines problems which are encountered in flight simulation. The paper concludes by reviewing the current trends in flight simulation.},
