\section{Simulation Methodology}
\label{sec:sim-method}

The objective of this section is to decompose the components of the simulation program from
high-level to low. As simulation programs are no simple task to implement, multiple modules emerge
to address specific tasks. At a systems level, these modules must then interact in such a fashion to
achieve the overall goal: avionics simulation.

TODO: Get the names and citation stuff here.
The most efficient method of presentation is [insert name here] as described in [insert citation
here] is to present the purpose of each module and describe how they interconnect. Then each module
will be discussed in more detail describing their inputs and outputs. After which the technical
discussion of the implementation will be presented.

\subsection{Overview}
In Python-like terms, a packages describes software that is composed of multiple modules. At the
subsystem level, there are three main packages: Core Avionics, External Sensors and Modules, as of
course the GMSE. The modules and their interconnectivity is shown in \autoref{fig:high-level}. The
core avionics module describes the suite of software being developed that that has immediate agency
to the behavior of the avionics system. For example, the Avionics Data Computer (ADC) is the "brain"
of the avionics system. It contains the vehicle's perceived external state as well as its internal
operating state. It also supplies flow of data at the correct rate to the correct system. The Flight
Control Module (FCM) utilized the data from the ADC to assist in maintaining stability and
controlling the vehicle to the waypoints described by the Flight Navigation Module (FNC).
